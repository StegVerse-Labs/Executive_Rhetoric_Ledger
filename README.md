# Executive_Rhetoric_Ledger

This repository performs cross-administration analysis of:

- executive rhetoric (verbatim statements)
- executive action (policy instruments)
- judicial response (litigation and injunctions)
- measurable outcomes (where supported by sources)

This repo is not an opinion archive.
It is a comparative research layer.

## Inputs

Primary records originate in:
- Trumpality
- Administrations

Ledger outputs are normalized datasets and comparisons.

## Key Rule

Fraud-based justifications are included **only** when a control comparison exists:
- comparable program type
- comparable fraud magnitude
- comparable enforcement tools
- comparable judicial posture
across both blue and red jurisdictions.

## Major comparison tracks

- Conditional funding leverage
- Selective enforcement patterns
- Rhetoric-to-action alignment scoring
- Court-block rate by instrument type
